## Summary
This challenge included 3 primary parts. These parts included data modeling, data engineering and data analyis. For the data modeling portion, I created an Entity Relationship Diagram of the tables using a tool called QuickDBD. After that, it was time to create the schema for each of the six CSV files and import the data. This is where the data engineering starts. It's extremely important to pay attention to the different data types, primary keys and foreign keys you use. This can affect you once you import your CSV files. The final portion of this challlenge was the Data Analysis portion. This part gave us some insight and answered all of our questions that we had about those that were employed during the 1980s and 1990s.
